# N-link-Pendulum
This projects contains my MATLAB code to simulate an n-link pendulum.
The project was part of the final assessment for MAE5730 - Intermediate Dynamics at Cornell University. 

The n-link pendulum is an extension of the simple pendulum. The motion of this pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. The motion of this is chaotic.

All the forces acting in this system are conservative forces. Friction between the hinges, friction due to air and any other energy losses are neglected. As a result, energy is conserved. The three methods used to obtain the equations of motions of the triple pendulum are:
1. Newton-Euler equations
2. Differential Algebraic equations (DAEs)
3. Lagrange equations
